This project implements Neural Style Transfer using TensorFlow and a pre-trained model to blend content and style images. Built and tested on Google Colab for easy replication and cloud-based execution.
Styled image examples are displayed directly in main.ipynb as part of the output.


Features
-Combines content and style from two input images
-Uses TensorFlow and a pre-trained VGG model
-Fully implemented in Google Colab – no setup required
-Styled image output is displayed directly in the notebook

How to Use
-Open main.ipynb in Google Colab
-Upload your content and style images
-Run all cells to generate the stylized image
-View the output directly in the notebook

File
-main.ipynb – Main notebook with full implementation and output display
